# Ornaat SVG editor: a webapplication to edit color en typeface of an SVG
This project, named "Ornaat SVG Editor," is a web application that empowers users to create personalized SVG images. Users can choose from a selection of SVG images, customize colors, and modify the font. Real-time updates allow users to see the changes as they personalize their image. Once satisfied, users can submit their design by clicking "Send."

Upon clicking "Send," users will receive an email containing the final image in PNG format, along with details of the chosen colors and font. Additionally, a notification email (with the same content) will be sent to the administrator's email address.
